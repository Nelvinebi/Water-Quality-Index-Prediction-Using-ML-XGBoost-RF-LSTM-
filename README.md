Water-Quality-Index-Prediction-Using-ML-XGBoost-RF-LSTM
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how Machine Learning (Random Forest & XGBoost) and Deep Learning (LSTM) can be used to predict Water Quality Index (WQI) from environmental parameters.

A synthetic dataset with over 100 data points was generated to mimic real-world water quality measurements such as pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, BOD, COD, nitrates, phosphates, TDS, conductivity, and fecal coliform levels.

The goal is to evaluate multiple models and compare their performance in predicting WQI.

📂 Dataset

A synthetic dataset (water_quality_synthetic.csv & .xlsx) is generated with 900 monthly records from 2010–2019.

Features include:

temperature_C

turbidity_NTU

pH

DO_mg_L

BOD_mg_L

COD_mg_L

nitrate_mg_L

phosphate_mg_L

TDS_mg_L

conductivity_uS_cm

fecal_coliform_CFU_100mL

Target:

WQI (Water Quality Index, scaled 0–100)
